Hello!

This is an interactive quiz we are building to test our javascript coding skills.

I started off first with creating a basic layout in HTML with empty elements that I would populate using javascript DOM manipulation. 

I then did some minor styling, and then focused on how I would get the quiz to work, specifically how it would collect the information contained within the button element when clicked and then how to compare that to what a correct answer should be. 

Once i got the many variables, arrays and queryselectors setup ( with many additions/removals ) , I then worked on getting the button presses , regardless of which button was pressed. to move us through the questions/answers.

I then worked on getting the score counted, added and combined for total score. I utilized a prompt to gather the users name and store it using .setItem in the local storage.
